FLAKY TESTS BIBLIOGRAPHY - "SHORT" REFERENCES VERSION

Contributors:
- Owain Parry
- Gregory Kapfhammer
- Michael Hilton
- Phil McMinn

Style guide:
- Use {} as opposed to  ""
- A tab/indent is two spaces
- Surround whole words with curly brackets in titles to preserve captilization, not just first letters
- Use author initials rather than full first name etc. with surname first; i.e. "Surname, I. and ..."
- Key is formed by first author surname, followed by publication year, followed by b/c/d... if multiple
  publications for that author in that year
- Entries ordered by key
- Paper titles should be in proper titlecase.

"Short" version only:
- For conference, "booktitle" should be "Proc. of ACRONYM", where acronym is the conference
  acronym. No expansion of the acronymn, no year.
- Omit page numbers, volumes, etc. (see "Order of fields" below)
- Order of fields:
    - inproceedings: author, title, booktitle (conference acronym + year), pages, year
    - article: author, title, journal, volume, number, pages, year
    - techreport: author, title, institution, number, year
    - misc: author, title (including URL, if one exists), year
