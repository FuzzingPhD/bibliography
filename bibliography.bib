Style guide:
- Use {} as opposed to  ""
- A tab/indent is two spaces
- Surround whole words with curly brackets in titles to preserve captilization, not just first letters
- Use author initials rather than full first name etc. with surname first; i.e. "Surname, I. and ..."
- Key is formed by first author surname, followed by publication year, followed by b/c/d... if multiple
  publications for that author in that year
- Entries ordered by key
- Paper titles should be in proper titlecase.
"Long" version only:
- Conference names take the format "Proceedings of the CONFERENCE_TITLE (CONFERENCE_ACRONYM)"
- Conference names omit conference number (e.g., "31st") and sponsorship (e.g., ACM/IEEE)
- Use en-dashes for ranges (e.g., page numbers), i.e. 10--20
- Order of fields:
    - inproceedings: author, title, booktitle, pages, year
    - article: author, title, journal, volume, number, pages, year
    - techreport: author, title, institution, number, year
    - misc: author, title (including URL, if one exists), year
